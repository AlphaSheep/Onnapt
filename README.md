Oh No! Not Another Puzzle Timer (Onnapt)
===============================================

*Onnapt* is going to be a cross platform timer application for twisty puzzles such as Rubik's cube. It is still in the early development phase.

Hopefully, three features will be added which will differentiate *Onnapt* from other timing applications:
 * Extensive history tracking, which allows exporting and importing times from other devices, and possible syncronising through Dropbox.
 * Calculation of a wide range of stats, which may be extended using plugins (which will be Python scripts)
 * Support custom scrambles as additional plugins

It is being written in Python 3 using PyQt.


License
-------
*Onnapt* is released under the MIT license, which makes it completely free to use and distribute. A copy of the license should have been included with the program.


Feature wishlist
----------------

The South African speed cubing community were asked the following questions:
 * What timer programs do you like to use? (doesn't matter if they're PC, web-based or mobile)
 * What are your favourite features?
 * What features do you hate?
 * What features don't your timers have that you wish they did have?

The following feature wish list was compiled from the answers:

 - [ ] Display averages
 - [x] Enable/disable inspection time
 - [x] Change length of inspection time
