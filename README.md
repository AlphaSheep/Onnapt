Statistics Lover's Awesome Puzzle Timer (SLAPT)
===============================================

*Slapt* is going to be a cross platform timer application for twisty puzzles such as Rubik's cube. It is still in the early development phase.

Three features will differentiate *Slapt* from other timing applications:
 * Extensive history tracking, which allows exporting and importing times from other devices, and possible syncronising through Dropbox.
 * Calculation of a wide range of stats, which may be extended using plugins (which will be Python scripts)
 * Support custom scrambles as additional plugins

It is being written in Python 3 using PyQt.

License
-------
*Slapt* is released under the MIT license, which makes it completely free to use and distribute. A copy of the license should have been included with the program.

The South African speed cubing community were asked the following questions:
 * What timer programs do you like to use? (doesn't matter if they're PC, web-based or mobile)
